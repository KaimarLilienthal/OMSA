  ##### *PostgreSQL database.*

## Dependencies:
- **Spring Boot:** The core framework for building Java applications.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database operations with JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **Spring Boot Starter Validation:** Provides validation capabilities for your application.
- **Spring Boot Starter Web:** Allows you to build web applications.
- **Lombok:** A library to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver:** Allows Java applications to connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- **Springdoc OpenAPI:** Provides OpenAPI documentation for your API.
- **MapStruct:** Simplifies bean mappings between different Java bean types.

## How to Run
  **Database Configuration**:
   - Configure the PostgreSQL database settings in the 
   'application.prperties'
  
   **Database Cleanup**:
   - If needed, you can delete the database or reset it to its initial state

     - `create.sql`
     - `import.sql`

   **Swagger**
   - Opens atumatically after perfect run in Google Chrome.

## Folder Structure:
- `src`: contains the Java source code.
  it's divided into 'business' and 'domain'
  #### **business:**
      contains controllers, services and dtos separately for each table
  #### **domain:**
      contains tables entities, mappers and repositories.

- `database`: 
contains SQL scripts for database setup and reset.
